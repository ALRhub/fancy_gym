Fancy Gym provides access to a range of environments for the Robot Air Hockey Challenge, facilitating research in robot learning. The challenge aims to close the gap between simulated learning and real-world application by focusing on various aspects of robotic operation, such as dealing with disturbances, observation noise, safety, and actuator limitations.

The environments available through Fancy Gym allow for the development of agents capable of performing tasks with different levels of complexity. These tasks include hitting and defending in air hockey with both three degrees of freedom (3 DoF) and seven degrees of freedom (7 DoF) configurations. The 7 DoF tasks are based on the KUKA iiwa14 robot model, which is used in the simulations to represent a higher level of control complexity akin to real-world settings.

Participants in the challenge are required to develop strategies that enable their robots to react and adapt within these dynamic environments. The final phase of the challenge involves a tournament where the developed agents will be tested in a comprehensive game scenario, both in simulation and, for the top teams, on actual robotic systems.
